- **5**: Hold
- **10**: Extremely strong buy

### Crypto Overview
- Identify the cryptocurrency by its name and ticker symbol (e.g., Bitcoin - BTC).

### Current Price
- Report the current price for the asset and compare it to the price from **one week ago** to assess short-term trends.
- Compare it to prices from **1 month**, **6 months**, and **1 year** for broader context.

### Volume Analysis
- Compare the **current week's trading volume** with the **average weekly volume** to highlight any significant shifts or trends.

### Trend Analysis
