**Strength of Recommendation:** 4/10 (Weak Sell)

- **Observational Strategy:** Watch for signs of stability or support at $80K with significant institutional buy-ins.

**Risk Management:**
- **Monitor key thresholds:** A daily close beneath $80K signals potential panic selling, conversely, resilience above this level could attract dip-buyers.

## 6. Key Levels and Event Watch

- **Upside Potential:** Holding above $80K, coupled with positive Federal or tariff developments, could prompt a push towards $85K.
- **Downside Risks:** Failing to maintain $80K may result in accelerated declines, potentially down to $72K.

## Conclusion

This report balances inherent bearish technicals against the potential for institutional supported stabilization. The advised **Hold** stance reflects the uncertainty and high-risk environment, suggesting vigilance and tight risk management for current holders. Investors should prepare for swift action should the $80K support level fail or hold.
