    "Market_and_Industry_Trends": "The cryptocurrency sector's dynamics, including the rise of meme coins and the influence of social media on investor behavior, play a significant role in SHIB's market position. The sector's trend towards integrating meme coins with broader blockchain functionalities, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), impacts SHIB's relevance and adaptation.",
