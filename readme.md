- Hash Rate: Indicates the computational power used to mine Bitcoin. A rising hash rate suggests a secure and growing network.
- Mining Difficulty: Reflects how challenging it is to mine Bitcoin. It correlates with hash rate and can signal miner confidence.
- Active Addresses: Measures the number of active wallet addresses. Higher activity may indicate increased network usage.
- Transaction Volume: Total Bitcoin value transferred on-chain. It shows how actively Bitcoin is being transacted.

**To be included in the future:**
- Network Value to Transactions Ratio (NVT): Similar to a P/E ratio in stocks, it compares Bitcoin's market cap to its transaction volume.
- Realized Cap: Evaluates the market cap based on the price at which each Bitcoin was last moved. It helps identify over/undervaluation.
